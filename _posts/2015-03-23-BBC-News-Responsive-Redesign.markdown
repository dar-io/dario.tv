    Description:

      - Paragraph: "In 2012, BBC News embarked on a journey to completely redesign and reengineer the News static site into a fully responsive mobile first site."

      - Paragraph: "The responsive site was first built and released targeting mobile devices. The objective was to progressively make way into a fully responsive desktop site. By rationalising and simplifying our design patterns into a single codebase, we could efficiently build 28 other World Service sites from a common set of components that are language and script agnostic."

      - Paragraph: "On Oct. 2013, I joined BBC News. Since then, as a UX Designer I led and helped improve many parts of the holistic BBC News experience."

      - Paragraph: "The final solution for the BBC News responsive website was an evolution of the existing version of the 'static' website rather than a radical re-design. The aim was to provide a much cleaner and clearer layout across all devices."
