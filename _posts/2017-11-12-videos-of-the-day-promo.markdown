    H2-Heading: The Problem
    Description:
      - Paragraph: "Videos of the Day (VotD) formerly known as Ten to Watch, was conceptualised and executed to be a package of ten videos accessed through a single access point from the app's top stories screen. This approach has created a few problems, such as:"

    U-List:
      - Bullet: "Users are not exploring the full package of videos. The further the videos are from the start of the carousel, the more significant is the drop in video views."  

      - Bullet: "We know that users who have visited VotD come back more frequently and view significantly more videos. But, there has been some potential adverse effects on the News app video viewing which has seen a (-24%) decline in daily video views."

    H2-Heading: The Approach
    Subheading:
    Description:
      - H3-Heading: The Three Amigos — Kick off session with UX, BA and Developers
      - Paragraph: |
           At the outset of the project, we agreed that it was essential for myself  (UX), a Business Analyst, an iOS and Android Developer to collaborate in building a shared understanding, on how we could deliver improvements to Videos of the Day and the BBC Stories promo.
      - Paragraph: |
          To improve the click-through rate into the Videos of the Day and BBC Stories experiences, we devised three hypothesis:
    O-List:
      - Bullet: <strong><i>If</i></strong> we display the number of videos in the package next to a <i>watch</i> CTA,  <strong><i>then</i></strong> more users will tap on the promo, scroll further down the package and watch more videos, <strong><i>because</i></strong> they will know how many videos are in the package.

      - Bullet: <strong><i>If</i></strong> we display the videos' headline and image rotating within the promo, <strong><i>then</i></strong> it will be more likely for users to tap on the promo, <strong> <i>because</i> </strong> showing more detail of the videos from within the package on the promo will help grab user's attention to explore the full package.

      - Bullet: <strong><i>If</i></strong> users have the option to preview the package of videos by using a carousel instead of a single promo, <strong><i>then</i></strong> users can pick the video that most interests them without initiating the vertical video experience. Consequently, this could increase video views <strong> <i>because</i> </strong>  we will be providing multiple access points into VotD in a non-linear fashion.

    Subheading: THE APPROACH
    H2-Heading:
    Description:

      - H3-Heading: Bringing designs to life
      - Paragraph: "Static designs are no longer an option. As a visual and interactive designer, my goal is to bring designs to life and insert them in context with real-world experiences. Such as demoing the interaction in native devices."

      - Paragraph: "I follow three rules in picking the best tools to prototype my designs. These are:"

    O-List:
      - Bullet: "<strong>How quickly can I build a prototype and how easy it is to iterate upon designs and interactions? </strong><br /><i>If time is an issue, I create low fidelity prototypes using static designs.</i>"

      - Bullet: "<strong>Can I recreate the interactions using native device technologies? </strong><br /><i> If I'm designing a website, I tend to prototype in HTML/CSS/JS.</i>"

      - Bullet: "<strong>Can the tool render designs and interactions efficiently and smoothly?</strong><br /><i>If I want to build high fidelity prototypes, device-native prototyping tools</i>"

    Description-post-bullet:
      - Paragraph: |
            For this project, I started making the prototypes using <a href="https://tumult.com/hype/">Tumult Hype</a>. I created the prototype in HTML/CSS. <a href="/assets/prototypes/NewsStreamPromo/00_NewStoriesPromo_first_versions.html" target="_blank"> Click here</a> to view several exploration prototypes built using Hype.

      - Paragraph: |
            To explore other types of interactions, I started using <a href="http://principleformac.com/">Principle</a> to create high fidelity prototypes with animations that feel fast and responsive.

      - Paragraph: "The explorations below designed in Sketch and interactions built in Principle."

    H2-Heading: Outcome
    Description:
      - Paragraph: "Although the carousel option proved to be successful, this approach challenges the editorial concept of a daily drop package of videos designed to be consumed linearly."

      - Paragraph: "Currently the introduction of the carousel as an entry point to Videos of the Day and BBC Stories is pending. The user journey of the original concept must be updated. The welcome and completion screens would need to be rethought to take in consideration a non-linear approach into the vertical video experience."
